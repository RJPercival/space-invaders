# Space Invaders

This is the classic game of Space Invaders, created using the Unity game engine. I created it as a way to learn the basics of game development with Unity.

## Controls

Use the arrow keys or A and D to move the ship. Press the space key to fire.

## Features

- A point is earned for each space invader destroyed.
- The space invaders steadily accelerate.
- The player's ship has limited power reserves, which recharge steadily and are consumed by each shot. This allows for quick bursts, or slower sustained firing.
